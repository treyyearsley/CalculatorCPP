# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{I wrote a calculator program. It allows the user to enter what kind of problem they want solved.
Their options are addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and remainder. Each option
will prompt the user to enter two numbers and the program will return the answer based on 
the operator they entered. It will also allow them to solve as many problems as the user wants.}

{My purpose in writing this program was to demonstrate the skills I have leanred in the C++ language.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
{I used Jetbrains Clion starter trial to develop this program and Github to make a repository
in which others can view the program.}

{I used the C++ programming language. The only library that I used was the standard library.
This just simplified the code and made it more efficient and simple.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I could convert the functions to separate classes.
- I could use inheritance of classes to simplify and reduce the redundancy of the code.
- I could turn it into an application with a user interface.
